* 1. What is the difference between position: absolute and position: fixed? *

Fixed is relative to the browser viewport, for example if something is
positioned 10px from the top with a fixed position, no matter how you change
the viewport, that element will always be on the same spot, 10px from the top.
Even if you scroll down, that element will not move. Handy with fixed navigation
bars that should always stay at the top.

The absolute position is relative to its first *positioned* ancestor (e.g. a parent that
has position:relative). Meaning if the ancestor moves, so does the element with
the absolute position, which always is on the same spot relative to the ancestor.
If there is no positioned ancestor, then the absolute position is relative
to the body of the document.

So the difference lies in what they are positioned relative to.


* 2. With CSS3, how do we access the third element within another element? *

Let's say you have an unordered list with 5 elements (<li> element within
<ul> element).
To select the third element you could write the following:
    ul li:nth-child(3) {}
