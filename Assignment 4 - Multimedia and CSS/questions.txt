Questions:
1. Why do mobile phones usually ignore auto play on video elements?

Answer: People often have limited data plans, so mobile sites should be lighter that is acceptable on
desktop. Therefore mobile phones will disable auto play to save mobile data for the user.


2. What will the CSS snippet at the end of this section do if the visitor is browsing on a device with
320 x 568 resolution?
@media only screen
and (min-device-width : 768px)
and (max-device-width : 1024px) {
#logo {
display: none;
}
}

Answer: The code snippet will do nothing for the visitor, as the media query will only kick
in for devices that are between 768px to 1024px in device width. For a tablet for example.


3. Mention some of the advantages of having a single responsive website instead of dedicated versions
like m.til.no for mobile and til.no for desktop?

Answer: There is less to maintain as you don't have to update two different websites for every new
design on the page. In addition users don't have to deal with two different urls for the page.
Let's say the user want's to share a link from cellphone, and is on the m.til.no, while the one
the user would want to share the page with is on desktop. How would you copy the link to that the
other person could see the desktop version? You'd probably have to remove the '.m' part from the link
manually. The same situation occurs if you bookmark something to view on desktop later, and the link
sends you to the mobile site. If you accidentally go to the mobile website, it would not show up
as user friendly for desktop.
